## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using only HTML (no external CSS or JavaScript).  
I focused on matching the original column structure and placing headlines, images, and article blocks in similar positions.

## Features Implemented
- HTML5 structure with semantic tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- 3-column layout using an HTML `<table>` (as required)
- At least 3 images (masthead + article photos)
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` to `h4`)
- Lists for navigation and brief updates
- Inline styles only for basic formatting (allowed)

## Challenges Faced
Balancing the column content without external CSS was challenging. I solved it by carefully splitting stories into sections and using minimal inline styles plus consistent spacing.
